# Numerical Features
# Customer ID here is just an id variable identifying a unique customer and has values between 1 and 30301
# On average, a customer from this set has been with the bank for 2400 days or around 6.5 years
# On average, a customer has less than 1 dependent and has an average age of 48 years
# A general trend on variables which are related to balances have a wide range with huge outliers, it will key to observe these outliers
# Most of the customers lie in category 2 or 3 for net worth and have on an average done the last transaction 70 days ago. Now the high net worth customers (Category) must have high credit, debit and balance values.

# Conclusions
# Average customer Profile
# Overall a customer at this bank:

# has no dependents
# has been a customer for last 6 years
# predominantly male
# either self employed or salaried customer


# Conclusion for Churn
# From the sample, around 17% customers are churning
# Current balance and average monthly balance values have a left skewed distribution as observed from the histogram
# No significant difference in distributions for average monthly balance and month end balances
# Bimodal distribution/Double Bell Curve shows that there are 2 different types of customers with 2 brackets of credit and debit. Now, during the modeling phase, these could be considered as a seperate set of customers
# For debit values, we see that there is a significant difference in the distribution for churn and non churn and it might be turn out to be an important feature
# For most frequent vintage values, the churning customers are slightly higher, while for higher values of vintage, we have mostly non churning customers which is in sync with the age variable
# Gender does not look like a very significant variable as the ratio of churned customers and others is very similar
# Self Employed and salaried have higher churn rate and are the most frequently occuring categories.
# Not much difference in customer net worth category when it comes to churn
